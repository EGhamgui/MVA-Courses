To run the code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/graphsml/graphsexercises.git
$ cd spectral_clustering
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We recommend you to create a virtual environment (e.g., [using conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands))
before installing `requirements.txt`
