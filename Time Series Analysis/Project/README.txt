In this repository, we provide : 

	- two notebooks (.ipynb files):
		* ML_Time_Series_project_Regression.ipynb   ->  contains all the experiments and results for the Regression task
		* ML_Time_Series_project_Classification.ipynb -> contains all the experiments and results for the Classification task

	- three .py files:
		* functions.py  -> contains the implementation of all the six feature selection methods
		* models.py     -> contains the code of the evaluation models : Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network
		* utility.py         -> contains utility functions for the two previous .py files

	- Two .csv files:
		* stock.csv : contains the data used for the Regression task (Stock Market data set)
		* wine.csv : contains the data used for the Classification task (Wine Quality data set)


NB. 
       Please open the notebooks in Google Colab Repository in order to display all the figures. We used Plotly package for visualizations which is not installed directly with Jupyter Notebook.
       Please put all the files together before running the notebooks.
